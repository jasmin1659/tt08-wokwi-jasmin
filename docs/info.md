## How it works

There are three modules: MyCounter (tests if the button is pressed or released), score (recieves the increment signal from MyCounter and sends the 7 segment information back to Wokwi module), and Wokwi (Takes the inputs from 
the buttons and clock. Then it sends the information to MyCounter. Next, it sends the information recieved by MyCounter back out to the 7 segment display and LEDs).
